My name is Michael Hemenway. I spend my working life helping organizations craft simple solutions to complex problems using emerging technologies. Denver is my home with my wife April and our children Micah and Amy. I spend my free time cycling this extraordinary city, with regular stops at the many cafes and tap rooms in the neighborhood.

I remain captivated by the ways we engage one another and texts online and how these practices shape the way we imagine the world. I hope this website will be a space where we can read closely together and share questions and ideas and artifacts related to the operations of interface in our emerging technological environment. Please feel free to use the hypothes.is plugin in the top right of most pages of this site or the disqus area at the bottom of any post on this site to get in touch with me about anything curious.
