My name is Michael Hemenway. I spend my working life helping organizations craft simple solutions to complex problems using emerging technologies. Denver is my home with my wife April and our children Micah and Amy. I spend my free time cycling this extraordinary city, with regular stops at the many cafes and tap rooms in the neighborhood.

I remain captivated by the ways we engage one another and texts online and how these practices shape the way we imagine the world. I hope this website will be a space where we can read closely together and share questions and ideas and artifacts related to the operations of interface in our emerging technological environment. Please, feel free to post a comment in the disqus area of any post on this site to get in touch with me about anyting curious.
