I live in a world that follows the rules. I have every ounce of privilege a person could imagine, so the world seems to be rather ordered for me. Yet, what does fair mean? Do i get a fair trial because people somehow make choices based on 'facts' of the case? Recently, I watched a few movies that reminded me how privileged my life is. To see how rebel fighters can treat anyone at their own whim and how white police officers treat black men without any accountability, i realize, that is not my life. If I run a stop sign on my bicycle and a police officer stops to reprimand me, what is the likelihood I'd get beaten or taken to jail on some charge? If i drive home from a brewery after a few drinks, do i have to worry about getting pulled over and prosecuted? Or will the law look away? Is this fair?

By fair, do we mean all people should be treated equally or the same? Is there any interesting circumstance that can be reduced to the same? Is fairness about measuring assessment/judgement, that the same process is used in every case?
