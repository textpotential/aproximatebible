## Summary  

Over 20 years of experience in theological education as a technologist, an instructor, a student, and an instructional designer has taught me to creatively explore, design, implement, and adapt technologies that bring the values of theological education into online and hybrid learning environments. A unique combination of broad experience, exceptional communication skills, and technical capacities allows me to translate complex institutional needs into fitting technological solutions and provide a bridge between organizational culture and emerging technologies.
