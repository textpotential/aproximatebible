# Keep it Simple

Relationship is the key to learning, not content. Focus on connecting with your students in ways that work for you. If this means email, do that. If this means Zoom calls, do that. If facebook is a place where you connect, then engage your students there. If you can connect and be present, the content will take care of itself. Set a rhythm of engagement that works for you and communicate this with students. 

# Maximize the Asynchronous

Move all content delivery and assessment to asynchronous modes. If you lecture, record your lecture in audio or video and allow students to engage it on their own time. **Do not get hung up on high production value here**. Keep each video short (even if you need several short ones) and use low-tech recording options (iphone or Zoom) and let students hear/see your personaility. 

Share small bits of content more often (a few sentences from a reading, brief video clips from YouTube, tweets, images, etc.) and ask direct questions to get students to engage through chat or discussion tools. 

# Strategic Synchronicity 

If you do decide to include synchronous moments (e.g. Google Meet or Zoom) in your course, use these times for dialog, sharing, and connecting, not for content delivery. Keep synchronous groups small if possible, use shared interest groupings around a specific topic or portion of course material to split the course into smaller groups. Synchronous moments can be great for case studies, debates, interviews, and brainstorming sessions. 

# Lead with Patience

Give yourself and your students permission to grieve the loss of on site learning time togehter. Learning together online is a different embodiment and we will do well not to ignore this and not to try to reproduce the on site learning experince online. This will only lead to disappointment. When possible, lead with curiosity. Allow yourself and your students to experiment with tools and platforms and rhythms, allowing time to critically reflect on what is working and what isn't.
