Intersecting Latour and Cronin, I see translation as one of the key capacities/dispositions needed to consider non-reductive and non-dominion-bound human relations with non-humans. I think translation as hospitality might be particularly useful here.
- I wonder how we might bring agonism as a practice/principle to this consideration?
- Cronin sort of names the challenge of translation across species
- Latour demonstrates the difficulty of translating across discourses even in humans without resolving to reducing one system to the demands of the other. What is the role of agonism in modes of existence?
- what theories/practices of translation would be useful here?
- Salah, how does your translation philosophy contribute?
- Ricoeur on translation 
- Valler 2021 paper on metamorphic zones from latour. inhuman translation as material linguistic practice, participate in a process of translating rather than translation into human frame. "to which we are attached and on which we depend" seems to be a statement of this process of transltation?


As a concrete and pertinent experiment in the value of translation for learning how to relate to machines, I think we ought take up the question of "explainability" as applied to ML models.
- what is the explainability movement in ML/AI?
- how is explainability connected to the objective fallacy with machines?
- how is explainability an immortality machine (Beal) and or a vehicle to sustain human dominion?
- how can we demand explainability without reducing 
- what is the relationship between explainability, transparency, and accountability?
- what is the role of accountability in translation?
- we could even take a kind of intersemiotic approach to interrogating explainabilty. What are the values driving this demand for explainability? can we translate these values differently?
- intepretation remains potential and translation becomes incarnate --> translation involves form and more selectivity
- empirical studies have to goals - explain and predict 
- perhaps we push the conversation toward interpretability through the vehicle of translation as interpretation.
