Dear Code Science Hiring Team,  
  
My name is Michael Hemenway and I am excited by the possibility of being a part of the creative family at Code Science as a Solutions Architect. For the last 18 years, I have been working with organizations to translate business needs into elegant technological solutions. Using tools like Zoom and Slack, I have enjoyed the opportunities to build dispersed, cross-functional teams to solve complex business problems with right-fit technologies through a highly interactive design process. Often speaking with end users, developers, and boards of directors as a consultant or as a CIO, I have proven to be an excellent communicator across a wide variety of constituencies. My unique combination of curiosity, communication skills, and capacity to learn technologies have made me an effective translator between the various stakeholders in a project. This translation work must negotiate interpersonal, workflow, and technical challenges that emerge at each stage of the product life cycle in order to provide suitable and sustainable solutions.  

The broad range of business areas I have worked with to implement cloud based solutions include IT infrastructure, finance, fundraising, recruiting, training, enrollment, marketing, libraries, and operations. My experience as a database administrator and instructional designer give me a strong technical background in SQL and in declarative design. I have led several database migration teams, which has enhanced my communication skills across functional areas and cultivated my ability to translate between different data models. Using APIs to integrate cloud and legacy systems has also afforded me skills beyond declarative design using languages like Python and web design tools such as CSS and JavaScript.  

This position interests me because I thrive in environments where translating between entities allows me to develop creative and strategically productive solutions with customers. I look forward to bringing my passion to learn, my desire to translate, and my broad experience into the Code Science family.  
<br \>

Sincerely,  
Michael
