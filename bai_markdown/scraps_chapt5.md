Yet, it is important to have a detailed sense of the assumptions built into the data shaping the interfaces we will discuss next, even if DBL has afforded rather high collaborative capacities in its bible interface. 

DBL does not look at all like a bible, it has no covers and nothing resembling pages, even at the XML level.^[Some REST APIs like that used by DBL do have a structure of pagination that returns only a certain number of data elements per request.] The content of what is typically considered bible is in DBL, in fact in over a thousand different languages including audio and text for many of these languages. Yet, given our discussion of interface as irreducible to content, the fact that DBL contains the texts usually held between the covers of a bound codex called bible is not enough to deem it bible. Does this bible interface afford proximity? Can we require this of bible interfaces? If so, are there bibles as we have known them that do not meet this requirement? It is critical to keep in mind the   

* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading. If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area. It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?
