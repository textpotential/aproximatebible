**Title: A Proximate Bible: Interfacing the Book of Books**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our reading and writing technologies. With the entangled histories of bible and book, our emerging media age and its transformation of book technologies forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. The connections between the major media transition from roll to codex in antiquity and the decided contemporary move toward the internet and mobile technologies as reading platforms encourage us to consider *bible as an interface that affords proximity through its high surface area, collaborative capacities, and anarchic tendencies*. I suggest bible as interface here to remind us that bible is more than a container of content to be consumed by a reader. Rather, bible as interface is a space constructed by the dynamic interplay of the material dispositions of the technological platform and the participation of the interested user. Affordances are particular enunciations of the possible relationships between platform and user in interface and bible demonstrates the particular affordance of proximity, a kind of encounter that demands the nearness of user engagement while maintaining a distance that resists any sort of mastery. Finally, interface characteristics that lend themselves well to the affordance of proximity are the many contact points of high surface area, the interruptive processes of collaborative capacities, and the irreducibility to any single original or governing principle provided by anarchic tendencies. 

**Introduction: Translating Book**

b. Interface as Space
d. Book as Interface
    i. Reader as User
    ii. Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production
        * Production
        * Probabilistic
        * Provoke
e. Pathways - John Miles Foley's Pathways Project as an Example
         
**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity **
Proximity is a valuable affordance that helps negotiate the familiar anxiety of changing notions of nearness and distance as new technologies emerge. 

a. Growing Anxieties - Anxieties about emerging technologies (Carr, Turkle, etc.) 
b. Nothing New - Plato on writing and memory
c. Dealing with Distance
    i. Distancelessness without Nearness (Hiedegger)
    ii. Proper Distance (Silverstone)
d. Proximity: Contact Without Grasp
    i. not about tech per se, but useful
    ii. proximity as increase in both nearness and distance
    iii. nearness as approach and responsibility
    iv. distance as resistance to mastery
    v. a proximate relationship: two resonances of the term
e. Interfacing Proximity
    i. poetry as proximate
    ii. bible as face in Levinas
f. Affording Proximity
    i. High Surface Area
    ii. Collaborative Capacities
    iii. Anarchic Tendencies

**Chapter 3: Interfacing Bible as Book **
Bible as book has the potential to provide a proximate interface. 

a. Bible on a Roll
    i. The Great Isaiah Roll
    ii. Surface Area: One Column at a Time
    iii. Communal Use: Collaborative Capacities
    iv. Hinting at Anarchy

    ii. *Scripta Continua* as Surface Area
    iii. Collaborative Annotations
    iv. Opening the Binding: Anarchy in Codex
c. Bible on Screen: Kindle Bible
    i. Proliferation of Interfaces
    ii. Collaborative Capacities and the Page
    iii. Annotation as Collaborative Capacity
    iv. Exponentially Expanding Non-Linear Access
d. Bible as a Proximate Book

**Chapter 4: Interfacing Bible: Barely Beyond the Book **

    ii. Translation and Physical Description
    iii. Transcription
e. Affording Proximity
    i. Expanding Surface Area
    ii. Hints toward Collaborative Capacities
    iii. Anarchic Possibilities Unrealized

**Chapter 5: Proliferation of Interfaces **
Moving decidedly beyond book, how will bible afford proximity in emerging media interfaces that are design to produce a proliferation of interfaces?

a. The Bible of Bibles - Digital Bible Library
    i. Bible in XML
    ii. The Demands of the Page Remain
    iii. Interfacing Interfaces
b. Bible Goes Mobile - The Bible App
