- chapter 1 Reading Interfaces: argues for interface as a relationship of user with environment that provokes probabilistic production and for book as interface 
- chapter 2 Affording Proximity: argues for proximity as a valuable affordance for interfaces such that interface affords both nearness (responsibility) and distance (resistance to mastery), care without consumption, contact without grasp. 
-- introduce affordance

- 
- chapter 4 Unbinding Non-Linear Access: argues that imagining bible beyond book, as a proximate interface can leverage some of the possibilities that were latent in book, but can be exploited more fully in interface beyond book once non-linear access comes unbound.
-- I used to argue here for book to cover (ha!) technologies from before codex and after, but here perhaps we reserve book for the technology that is a container for texts and begin to use the more open language of interface (of which book is one example) to talk about use of bible. 
-- same content in DBL can provide a proximate interface through API. Look closely at bible app here.

Maybe in roll and codex, form facilitates nearness at risk of irradicating distance, but the content of bible resists this collapse and remains distant. As the conent of bible becomes over familiar OR becomes merely a prop for interface with bible as cultural icon, how can we conceptualize bible as still proximate? In emerging interfaces, do we see both form and content entangle to promote the affordance of proximity in new and interesting ways, or does new media just heighten our addiction to nearness? 

Interface is contact that demands distance. 
- interface as space of contact (space as process)
- proximity as contact that demands distance
-- a subjectivity from Levinas that can inform our theory of interface and 
-- proximity is nearness without mastery

Overall, I am arguing for ??
- chapter 1 argues that interface is a space that demands difference 
- chapter 2 argues that this notion of interface can be a space of and for proximity
- chapter 3 argues for bible as a proximate interface 
- chapter 4

So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion. An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of biblical interpretation entirely differently. 

I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign. Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original*. 

Maybe instead of affording anarchy, i am really talking about interfaces that afford proximity and maybe proximity is an extension of the provocation of probabilistic production introduced by Drucker.  Not all interfaces afford proximity to same degree. 

Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.
